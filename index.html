<p>Cuba, is a unique place, not only because of all the old cars or tear down colonial infrastructure. but also because of it's hidden capitalist economy that works behind the propaganda of socialism. Most people in Cuba work for the government, they have very little chance to call anything their own. The tourism industry is the only option that locals have to make a decent living. Which is why is common to see college professionals as doctors and engineers drive cabs for living. Here is a short clip of a video i made while driving by "El Malecon" Havana most famous street. Cuba also has beautiful natural views and is a must go to any passionate photographer</p>
